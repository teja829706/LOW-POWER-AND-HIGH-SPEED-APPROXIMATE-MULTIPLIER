##  Abstract

Approximate computing offers a powerful strategy to reduce power consumption and design complexity by relaxing the requirement for perfect accuracy. This project proposes novel energy- and quality-efficient approximate multipliers. By employing NAND gates for complemented partial product generation and innovative approximate compressors, the design significantly reduces the transistor count and energy consumption. The designs are evaluated using **Cadence Virtuoso** and **Xilinx Vivado** simulation tools.
